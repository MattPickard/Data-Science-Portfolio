## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of how to impliment various RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to query a text dataset, in this case, a memoir written by my grandfather. The goal was to gain better intuition for 

## Data

The data is a memoir written by my grandfather. The memoir is a collection of his memories and experiences from his life. The memoir is 100,000 words long and contains a lot of information about his life.

## RAG Architectures

There are two RAG architectures that will be used in this project. The first is a simple RAG architecture that will be used to query the memoir. The second is a more complex RAG architecture that will be used to query the memoir.
