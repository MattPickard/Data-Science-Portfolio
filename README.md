In this repository, you will find a collection of my data science and machine learning projects. I hope you find them useful and interesting!

# Projects

### **RAG Pipelines to Query my Grandfather's Memoir ([Link](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Memior%20RAG%20Project))**

###### **Tags:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reranking, Context Enrichment, Information Retrieval, LangChain, Microsoft GraphRAG, OpenAI API, Query Rewriting, Prompt Engineering

In this project, I demonstrate the application of various RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques that are often used in the information retrieval and response generation applications. The findings reveal how enhancements like reranking and context enrichment through an ensemble approach can significantly improve retrieval success rates.



### **Turbofan Engine Prognostics ([Link](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project))**

###### **Tags:** Convolutional Neural Networks, CatBoost, Big Data, Regression and Binary Classification, Engine Prognostics, TensorFlow/Keras, Preprocessing, Cross-Validation, Feature Extraction, Data Visualization

This project utilizes a NASA run-to-failure dataset to develop hybrid models that predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and health status of turbofan engines. By integrating one-dimensional convolutional neural networks with CatBoost models, this approach effectively captures the temporal patterns present in sensor data. The resulting predictions serve as valuable tools for engineers, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and monitoring engine health.
