**[RAG Pipeline to Query my Grandfather's Memoir](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Memior%20RAG%20Project)**

This project demonstrates the application of various RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques that are often used in the information retrieval and response generation applications. The findings reveal how enhancements like reranking and context enrichment through an ensemble approach can significantly improve retrieval success rates while balancing complexity and performance.

**[Turbofan Engine Prognostics](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project)**

This project utilizes a NASA run-to-failure dataset to develop hybrid models that predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and health status of turbofan engines. By integrating one-dimensional convolutional neural networks with CatBoost models, this approach effectively captures the temporal patterns present in sensor data. The resulting predictions serve as valuable tools for engineers, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and monitoring engine health.
